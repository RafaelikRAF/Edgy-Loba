### Purpose:
To give Apex Legends players their stats in an easy and convenient way inside of Discord. Great for servers who like to display their users stats and achievements. At first the bot was just developed for fun in a private server but now it is being actively worked on for everyone to use.

### Commands: 
\>**help**- See the commands of the bot. <br />
\>**link** [Apex IGN] [PC/X1/PS4] - Link your Discord account to your Apex user. Doing this allows you to see history graphs, collaborate in the leaderboard and much more. <br />
\>**unlink** - Unlink your discord account from your Apex user.<br />
\>**stats [Optional: Apex IGN] [Optional: PC/X1/PS4]** - Shows Apex stats for given user. If you have a linked account you don't have to insert your Apex IGN to check your own stats. <br />
\>**top** - Shows the current leaderboard for the server the user is in. <br />
\>**map** - Shows the current and next maps for Battle Royale and Arenas gamemodes. Also the time remaining until the next map. <br />

### Commands that are being worked on:
\>**status** - Show the server status of Lobby/Matchmaking server by region. <br />
\>**gtop** - Global top leaderboard for every Discord server that has the bot in it.\ <br />
