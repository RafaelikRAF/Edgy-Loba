### Purpose:
To give Apex Legends players their stats in an easy and convenient way inside of Discord. Great for servers who like to display their users stats and achievements. At first the bot was just developed for fun in a private server but now it is being actively worked on for everyone to use.

### Commands: 
\>**help**- See the commands of the bot <br>
\>**link** [Apex IGN] [PC/X1/PS4] - Link your Discord account to your Apex username. Doing this allows you to see history graphs, collaborate in the leaderboard and much more.<br>
\>**unlink** - Unlink your discord account from your Apex user.<br>
\>**stats [Optional: Apex IGN] [Optional: PC/X1/PS4]** - Shows users stats. Must use origin username steam wont work. If you have a linked account and want to check your own stats there is no need to add [Apex IGN] or platform.<br>
